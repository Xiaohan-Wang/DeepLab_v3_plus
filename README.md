# DeepLab_v3_plus
An implementation of DeepLab v3+, with the reference on https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception. 

This project is used to 
* make myself get familiar with the basic structure of DL projects;
* decouple most modules so that they can be easily reused;
* learn [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) to clearly track experiments parameters, results, etc.

TODO list
* [ ] Have a seperate template repo.
